## Troubleshooting
If you have got ‘JRE Not Found’ or ‘JRE Missing’ error from your OS when you are going to run the application first time. That means first of all ‘JRE’ should be install into your computer. So in such like case, Please visit [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and download the latest ‘JRE 8’ version suitable for your OS.

This application needs 'MYSQL' server to be installed and a database should be created with the name 'ardms'. Also, required database tables should be created in the database. 
Download MYSQL by visiting [https://www.mysql.com/downloads/](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) and database source code can be found in the 'src/lk/ijse/ardms/db' folder.
